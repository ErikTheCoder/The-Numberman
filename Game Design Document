This game is gonna be about a person counting numbers larger and larger. 
Number range: we're pretty much gonna go through everything from 1 to the thousands and googols and tetration and stuff.
(I hope to be able to touch on FGH's as well)

There are gonna be achievements, wich you get by reaching certain numbers.
These achievements are all gonna have rewards.

Actual game mechanics:

You're gonna have A number in the top center of the screen, with a buitton below it wich says "count".
This button is gonna increase your number by 1 (can be more later on with more upgrades).

Autocounters: These are things that will automatically count for you, each one will be +1/s(upgradeable later on), and will increase in cost(10 * formula: 1.1^owned_autocounters).

Multipliers: These things cost autocounters, but will increase their efficiency by *2 (multiplicative), and their cost will increase.(formula:10 * 3^owned_multipliers).
